Interpolation and Approximation with Lagrange Polynomials

Project Description
This project implements a numerical computation application for interpolation and approximation using Lagrange polynomials. The application allows users to input a set of points and generate the Lagrange interpolation polynomial that passes through these points. Additionally, users can input a number of additional points to visualize the approximation of unknown points using the same polynomial.

Implemented Features

Lagrange Interpolation: Generation of the Lagrange interpolation polynomial for a set of user-input points.
Approximation: Generation of a number of interpolated points based on the Lagrange polynomial and visualization on a graph.
Animation: Animated visualization of the interpolation process, showing how the polynomial passes through each generated point.
Continuous Validation: Verification of the continuity of the user-input function.
Graphical Interface: An intuitive and user-friendly interface created using PyQt5 and Matplotlib for graph visualization.
